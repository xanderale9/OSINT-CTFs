📌 Description

  We were provided with a social media dataset (social_media_scrape.jsonl).
  The goal was to find the user_id of the person who commented the exact phrase:

  "project horizon"

  on posts from exactly 5 distinct authors.

  🛠 Approach

  1. Open the file line by line (JSON Lines format).

  2. Filter comments that match the exact phrase.

  3. Track the authors each commenter interacted with.

  4. Identify the user who interacted with exactly 5 distinct authors

✅ Script Used

  import json
  from collections import defaultdict

  phrase = "project horizon"
  authors_by_user = defaultdict(set)

  with open("social_media_scrape.jsonl", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
      for line in f:
          data = json.loads(line)
          if data.get("comment_text") == phrase:
              user = data["user_id"]
              author = data["post_author_id"]
              authors_by_user[user].add(author)

  for user, authors in authors_by_user.items():
      if len(authors) == 5:
          print("Target user_id:", user)
