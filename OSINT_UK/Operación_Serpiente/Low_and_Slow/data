📌 Description

  We were given 200,000 lines of firewall logs (firewall_logs.csv).
  The objective was to detect a stealthy “low-and-slow” brute-force pattern:

      14 failed login attempts
      Immediately followed by 1 successful login
      All within a 3.5-second window

🛠 Approach

  Load the CSV with pandas and convert the timestamp column to datetime.
  Group entries by IP and sort by timestamp.
  Search for sequences of 14 failures followed by 1 success within 3.5 seconds.

✅ Script Used
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.read_csv("firewall_logs.csv")
  df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"])
  df = df.sort_values(["ip_address", "timestamp"])

  for ip, group in df.groupby("ip_address"):
      events = group["status"].tolist()
      times = group["timestamp"].tolist()
      for i in range(len(events) - 14):
          window = events[i:i+15]
          if window.count("FAIL") == 14 and window[-1] == "SUCCESS":
              if (times[i+14] - times[i]).total_seconds() <= 3.5:
                  print("Suspicious IP:", ip)
