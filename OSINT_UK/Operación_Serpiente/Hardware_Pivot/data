📌 Description

  After extracting metadata, the Make and Model tags had been removed.
  The task was to identify the camera make and model from other EXIF traces.

🛠 Approach

      Check hidden EXIF tags, lens info, serial numbers, and software signatures.

    Recommended command:

      exiftool target.jpg


Then analyze output to deduce the camera make and model. I searched serial number on missing cameras site.
